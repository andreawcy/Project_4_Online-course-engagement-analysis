    "  - Create some sort of interactivity with the graphs, most likely with a Tableau dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. **SQL Database**\n",
    "  - Populate a SQL database using the CSV file, then connect to the database in order to continue analysis.\n",
    "  - **Bonus:** Set up a SQL database server and connect to it via internet as opposed to a direct sqlite file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. **Data Modeling**\n",
    "  - Create a relational data model, or a graph data model.\n",
    "  - Use supervised learning.\n",
    "  - Create a Logistic Regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D. **Model Optimization and Evaluation**\n",
    "  - Try using a different number of layers, activations, optimizers, and epochs to maximize the accuracy of our model.\n",
    "  - Try splitting the data to optimize the model.\n",
    "  - Try using the Adam algorithm with our model for further optimization.\n",
