### Project 4 - Online Course Engagement Analysis

Team 9 - Rachel Schoen, Andrea Wu, Mahind Rao, Mahalel Peter

## Key Statement
What are the key factors that influence whether a user completes a 
course?
- Can we build a predictive model to forecast course completion status 
based on user engagement metrics and demographics?
- How does the time spent on a course correlate with the likelihood of 
course completion?
- Is there a minimum number of videos that users need to watch to 
significantly increase their chances of completing the course?
- What engagement patterns (e.g., frequent short sessions vs. infrequent 
long sessions) are most common among users who complete courses?
